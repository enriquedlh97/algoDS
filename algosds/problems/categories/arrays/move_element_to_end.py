Problem:

You're given an array of integers and an integer. Write a function that moves all instances of that integer in the array
to the end of the array and returns the array.

The function should perform this in place (i.eâ€ž it should mutate the input array) and doesnt need to maintain the order
of the other integers.

Input:

    array: [2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2]
    to_move: 2

Output:

    [4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

    This solution works by initializing pointers to the beginning and end of the input array. The right pointer moves
    elements that do not correspond to the indicated value in the variable to_move. The left pointers moves elements
    that due correspond to the to_move value. Essentially, everytime both the left and right pointers find valid values
    they perform a swap.

    The execution is done until both pointers meet each other.

    This solution is very similar to the previous two solutions. The difference is that a for loop is used to iterate
    over the input array and the values that do not correspond to to_move values are popped out of the array and saved
    to a temporary one. The values that due correspond to the to_move value are popped and appended to the original
    array. At the end, the temporary array containing the non-valid values is prepended to the original array.
